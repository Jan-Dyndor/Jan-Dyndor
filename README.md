## 📂 My Projects

Here are a few of my selected data science and machine learning projects:

- 🧠 **[Alzheimer’s Detection Using MRI Scans](https://github.com/Jan-Dyndor/alzheimer-mri-detection)**  
  Deep learning project using CNNs (ResNet50, VGG16, EfficientNetB4) to classify MRI scans and detect Alzheimer's disease. Includes patient-level data splitting, augmentation analysis, and binary vs multi-class comparison.
- 🧠 **[Garbage Classification with ResNet50](https://github.com/Jan-Dyndor/Garbage-Classification/tree/main)**
  This project utilizes transfer learning with the ResNet50 architecture to classify garbage images into multiple categories.
> More projects coming soon – stay tuned!
